# python While loop
# while loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true.The syntax of a while loop in python is as follows:

"""
inititializing of a variable
while keyword,
followed by the condition/statement to be evaluated,
followed by a full colon(:),
code to be printed out,
increment/decrement
"""

number = 0
while number < 5:
    print("Hello Moses",number)
    number = number + 1


print('==============================')
# create a python program that prints the even numbers from 50 to 70 using while loop
number = 50
while number <= 70:
    print(number)
    number = number + 2

# below is a decreament example that prints the multiples of 3 starting from 201 to 150
number = 201
while number >= 150:
    print(number)
    number = number - 3

# below is an example of an infinite loop it is a loop that never ends because the condition is always true.
# number = 1
# while number > 0:
#      print(number)
# number = number + 1
